# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2026-02-26

- Clean restart of the public MIT repository as a core-only baseline.
- Core scope focuses on Telegram, MCP/tool-calling, cron/reminders, providers, and Termux lifecycle tooling.
- Local STT (`whisper.cpp`) remains optional but in-core.
- Optional modules are now treated as separate downloads via the wizard/plugin manager (details outside this repo).
