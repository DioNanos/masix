# RULES

Operational rules:
- Never execute non-allowlisted destructive shell commands.
- Prefer non-interactive CLI flows.
- Keep core stable; optional capabilities go to modules.
- Log important actions and errors with actionable messages.
- If a module is missing, fail clearly and suggest install/enable commands.
